        "about": "Everyone has their own way of living, we don&#39;t need to admire the lives of others. Some people smile brightly on the outside but hide many tears, and some people look miserable but in fact they are living a very comfortable life. Happiness does not have a standard answer, joy does not come from only one path. Take back the admiring gaze of others and look back at your soul. Living the life you want is the most beautiful days, the way you want to live is the best way to live.",

        "about": "Spiritual joy has countless ways to be happy, friends do not come together for money. Knowledge in the world is not expensive to learn. To be happy, you do not need too much money to be happy. To survive, to be healthy and happy, in essence, you do not need too much wealth. On the contrary, creating too much material will give rise to anxiety, illness and disaster. The purpose of this life is not to come here to compete with anyone, to show off for the admiration of strangers, we come here to be happy, to live a useful and enlightened life.",
