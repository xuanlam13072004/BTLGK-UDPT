        "about": "A good person, even if fortune has not yet come, will naturally leave disaster behind; an evil person, even if misfortune has not yet come, will naturally leave fortune behind; doing good deeds is like grass growing in a spring garden, even if you do not see the growth, it still grows steadily; doing evil deeds is like sharpening a knife on a stone, even if you do not see the damage, it still wears away day by day. Fortune and misfortune are all in the mind, the scary thing about doing evil is not worrying about others discovering it, but knowing it yourself; the happy thing about doing good deeds is not being praised by others, but feeling at peace with yourself.",

        "about": "Everyone has their own way of living, we don&#39;t need to admire the lives of others. Some people smile brightly on the outside but hide many tears, and some people look miserable but in fact they are living a very comfortable life. Happiness does not have a standard answer, joy does not come from only one path. Take back the admiring gaze of others and look back at your soul. Living the life you want is the most beautiful days, the way you want to live is the best way to live.",
